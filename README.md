# Statistical-rethinking

I'm (slowly) following along with Richard McElreath's Statistical Rethinking 2022 course (after making it about 75% through the 2019 course).  

Lectures available on youtube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cclUd_HoRlo&list=PLDcUM9US4XdMROZ57-OIRtIK0aOynbgZN) and homework and other resources available on github [here](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022)
